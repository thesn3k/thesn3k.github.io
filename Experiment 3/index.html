                Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; formerly stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[2]

Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass, and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.

After his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.[3] He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery was released the following year. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).

            <h3>Early career, Infinite and family struggles</h3>
            <p>In 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group New Jacks and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers.[1][26][27] In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends.[28] They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof.[8] Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, "Do-Da-Dippity", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released their first album Devil's Night in 2001.[15] Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.[14]</p>

            <h3>Deborah Rae</h3>
            <p>The only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae "Debbie" (née Nelson).[9][10][11] He is of English, Scottish, German, German Swiss, Polish and Luxembourgian ancestry.[12][13] His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him.[14] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. Eminem's father, Bruce Jr., left the family, moving to California[15] after having two other children: Michael and Sarah.[16] His mother, Debbie, later had a son named Nathan "Nate" Kane Samara.[11] During his childhood, Eminem and his mother shuttled between Detroit and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah and Kansas City.[17][18]</p>

            <h3>Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr.</h3>
            <p>As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father. Debbie said that they all came back marked "return to sender".[15] When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head in an assault,[19] an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song "Brain Damage". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by the Macomb County, Michigan judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.[14] Eminem and his mother lived for much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood.[15] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.</p>
