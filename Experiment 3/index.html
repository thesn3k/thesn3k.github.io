                Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, songwriter and radio personality, who
                has been active in music for several decades. He gained worldwide fame in the 1980s, having multiple
                hits including his signature song "Never Gonna Give You Up", "Together Forever" and "Whenever You Need
                Somebody", and returned to music full-time in the 2000s after a 6 year hiatus. Outside his music career,
                Astley has occasionally worked as a radio DJ and a podcaster.
                Born and raised in Lancashire, Astley became a musician after leaving school, as the drummer for the
                soul band FBI. Three years later, he rose to fame through his association with the production trio Stock
                Aitken Waterman; releasing the 1987 album Whenever You Need Somebody, which sold 15.2 million copies
                worldwide. His debut single "Never Gonna Give You Up" was a number 1 hit single in 25 countries, winning
                the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single. His 1988 single "Together Forever" became his second
                single to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and was one of his eight songs to reach the top ten on the UK
                Singles Chart. The title track was a No 1 single in seven countries, and it reached No 3 in the UK. In
                1988, Astley followed-up his debut album with Hold Me In Your Arms. The lead single "She Wants to Dance
                with Me" was Astley's first single that he wrote himself, and it became a worldwide top 10 hit.

            <h3>Mr. Horace Astley</h3>
            <p>Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire, the fourth child of his family.
                His parents divorced when he was five and Astley was brought up by his father Horace Astley.[11] Astley
                remained in very close contact with his mother Cynthia Astley, who lived a few streets away from his
                father. After finding out that his father was the one who kicked his mother out of the house, Astley
                distanced himself from his father. When he was 10 years old, Astley began singing in a local church
                choir, which began his love of music.</p>
